# CPU280-ZNODE51
Hi guys, I used to run the ZNODE51 when it still was a BBS
I am using a Tilmann Reh CPU280 with a harddisk and two floppy drives. 
With the inputs from Hajo Kitzhoefer also from Munich like myself
I managed to get a VGA Terminal running off a VGA32 plus MAX232 serial converter. 
I use the Kaypro emulation to access my Z3PLUS environment with a VT00D TermCap.
Now I ran into the problem, that German Umlauts are not visible in textfiles and 
pressing the proper keys on my German keyboard does not echo the correspnding Umlauts.
So I will appreciate help in getting a sort of translation code into the VGA32 to
remedy this. 
If anyone has an idea, please let me know.
